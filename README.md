## Overview

This project is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Python. It provides users with two gameplay modes: single-player mode against a rule-based AI opponent and two-player mode for local multiplayer play. 

The system features comprehensive input validation to prevent invalid or duplicate moves, automatic turn management between players, and real-time game-end detection after every move. In single-player mode, the AI employs strategic rule-based logic prioritizing winning opportunities, blocking opponent wins, controlling the center, and random fallback strategies.

Overall, this project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as modular design, conditional logic, loops, user interaction, and simple decision-based AI in an interactive terminal application.

## Project Features

### 1. Main Menu
- Displays a clear game title and menu when the program starts
- Offers two modes:
  - **1 Player** — Play against the computer (AI)
  - **2 Players** — Play with a friend on the same computer
- Validates user input; displays an error message if anything other than `1` or `2` is entered, then re-displays the menu

### 2. Game Board Display
- Shows a clean text-based 3×3 grid using `|`, `-`, and spaces
- Numbers positions **1 to 9** on empty cells so players know which number to enter
- Updates the board after every move to reflect **X** and **O** placements

### 3. Two-Player Mode
- Player 1 uses **X**, Player 2 uses **O**
- Players alternate turns, entering a number from **1 to 9**
- If a spot is already occupied or the input is invalid, an error message displays and the same player can re-enter their move

### 4. Single-Player Mode (vs AI)
- Human player uses **X**, AI uses **O**
- AI employs rule-based logic with the following priority:
  1. Win if possible
  2. Block the player's winning move
  3. Take the center square (position 5) if available
  4. Otherwise, choose a random available spot

### 5. Win and Draw Detection
- After every move, the game checks for a winner (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- If the board is full with no winner, the game declares a **tie/draw**
- Displays the final board and announces the result before ending

### 6. Input Validation
- Rejects non-numeric input
- Rejects numbers outside the range 1–9
- Rejects moves on already-occupied cells

## How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies (standard library only)

### Installation and Execution

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simanto4321/CSE440-section-01--TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME-.git
   cd tic_tac_toe
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen menu to select a game mode (1 or 2 players)

4. Enter numbers 1–9 to place your move on the board

## Game Rules

- **Objective:** Get three of your marks (X or O) in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
- **Valid Moves:** Enter a number from 1 to 9 corresponding to an empty cell on the board
- **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns automatically
- **Game End:** The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (draw)

## Notes

- This is an educational project for CSE 440 (Artificial Intelligence)
- The AI opponent uses a simple rule-based strategy, not machine learning
- All code is written in Python using only the standard library
